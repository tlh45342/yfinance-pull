# yfinance-pull
example code for pulling financial data using yfinance

Yahoo appears to keep 1M data for 2 Weeks

When you ask for data beyond what is available you will see something like....
- LC: No data found for this date range, symbol may be delisted

This a "test" project. 
The example piece does have the storage address hardcoded to drive M.
I run python on Windows, Linux, and Apple.
It is expected that you would alter the code to fit your environment.

The example files in pull_1M show a piece of code in a series of strages of development.
The later piece will use a CSV file aptly named "tradingpool.csv" as the source of a series of downloads.
